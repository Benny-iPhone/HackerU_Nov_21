Layout

=====================
Agenda
=====================


Basic Constraints
- leading
- trailing
- top
- bottom
- height 
- width

Relative 
- center x
- center y
- relative width
- relative height

Align Items to each other
Complex Element
(icon - text)

Priority and animation
Layout per device size

=====================
Intro
=====================




Every element neends to know its x, y, width , height (frame)
some elements define their own width and height
- label, button, imageview, switch (by content)
for example,in label.
we can set custom width for line breaking
some does not know
- view, scrollview, tableview
some knows by thier children
- stackview, custom views

if we failed to fulfill x,y,width,height -> we get red error in storyboard
- some might be missing
- some might conflict

=====================
Use cases
=====================


1) Yellow Rectangle in left top corner
using UIView
- x: distance from left side (leading) - 16
- y: distance from safe area top (top) - 12
- w: constact width (100)
- h: constact height (100)

2) Green Rectangle in right bottom corner
using UIView
- x: distance from right side (trailing) - 16
- y: distance from safe area bottom (bottom) - 12
- w: constact width (100)
- h: constact height (100)

more about leading trailing vs right/left
in RTL locale (for example english):
leading == left
trailing == right
in LTR locale (for example hebrew, arabic):
leading == right
trailing == left

Add support to hebrew:
Project -> project -> Localization -> + -> select locale

In order to ignore language direction:
Click on element -> size inspector -> double click on layout constraint -> First Item -> Uncheck "Respect Language Direction"

more about safe area

3) add blue rectangle to the device top
- x: distance from right side (trailing) - 0
- y: distance from screen top (bottom) - 0 (not safe area)
- w: constact width (200)
- h: constact height (200)

4) add label to yellow view
- x: leading 8
- y: top (to yellow view) 8
- w: auto
- h: auto

when label text is too long, the label is exceeding the parent view
we can check "clip to bounds" to limit the label overflow

4.1) label from left to right, with background color, 2 lines
- x,w: trailing - 8
=> label know where to start, where to end -> x, width

5) Teal reactangle
x: leading 20
y: top 8 to yellow view
w: trailing 20
h: constant 128

Advanced constant

6) label
x: leading 8
y: top 8 to teal
w: according to text, limit to safe area trailing by 8
h: auto (single line)

edit trailing:
Click on label -> size inspector -> select trailing constraint -> double click -> change equal to "equal or greater than"

=====================
Use cases - relative layout
=====================

1) Yellow view (UIView)
a rectable in the middle of the view, 20% width , 20% height
x: center
y: center
w: 20% to safe area
h: 20% to safe area
Drag from element to its parent and select the proper option (center hotizonaly/verticaly, equal width/height)
Edit constaint: change multiplier to 0.2 or 1/5

2) Background image using relative layout
- add an image (jpeg/png/svg) to assets
x: center (view)
y: center (view)
w: 100%
h: 100%
you might need to change reference from safe area to superview, you can do so by editing the constraint's second item

3) add view in relative dimenssions
start from 0.25 screen width
white UIView
width double than yellow view
leading x: 1/4 superview width
width: 2 * yellowView.width
height: 1 * yellowView.width
y: something

aspect ratio (3:4)
4) A view of ratio 3:4
height is 4/3 of width of screen
x: some
y: some
w: screen width
h: 4/3 * screen width (edit constraint value)

=====================
Complex
=====================

Elemet contains
image, text

A view with some dimenssions
inside imageview and label
label: x: 8, y: center to imageview, trailing to image: 8
imageView: leading to label: 8, top: 8, bottom: 8 trailing: 8

=====================
Peek Card
=====================

a View is in to bottom of the main view with constant height
x: 8
width: full - 16 (trailing 8)
bottom: 0

collapsed: height 80
expanded: top 120
toggle priority
